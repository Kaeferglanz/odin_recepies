   <h1>Recipe for Bavarian Potato Soup</h1>
    <img src="../images/Kartoffelsuppe nach Bayrischer Art (Bavarian Potato Soup) Recipe.png" height="500" widht="500">
    <p id="head">Kartoffelsuppe is a classic Bavarian-style potato soup that's packed with sausage and vegetables. It is more of a main dish than an appetizer. In Germany, the sausage of choice would be Regensburg sausage, a short and stubby parboiled pork sausage. It can be substituted with other boiling sausages made of pork.</p>
