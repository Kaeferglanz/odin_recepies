    <h3><li>Step</li></h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 180°C (160°C fan), though you can use your slow cooker or stove instead</p>
    <h3><li>Step</li></h3>
    <p>Season beef – Toss the beef with half the salt and pepper. Then proceed to cooking the onion by heating the oil and melting the butter in a lagre oven-proof dutch oven over high heat. Cook the onions for 6min until the edges are light golden.</p>
    <h3><li>Step</li></h3>
    <p>Cook beef – Add the beef and stir until the outside changes from red to brown, about 2 minutes. It won't go golden brown, it's not supposed to.</p>
    <h3><li>Step</li></h3>
    <p>dd vegetables – Add garlic, capsicum and tomato. Stir for 3 minutes – the tomato will mostly breakdown. Afterwards add paprika, caraway and bay leaf. Stir for 30s.</p>
    <h3><li>Step</li></h3>
    <p>low cook – Add beef stock, stir, bring to simmer. Cover with a lid and transfer to the oven for 1 1/2 hours.</p>
    <h3><li>Step</li></h3>
    <p>Add potato – The beef should be pretty tender but not quite "fall-apart". Stir in carrot and potatoes. Return to oven, covered, for another 30 minutes. Beef should now be "fall-apart" – if not, return to the oven for 10 minutes at a time.</p>
    <h3><li>Step</li></h3>
    <p>Last but not least, serve the dish.  Ladle goulash into bowls and sprinkle with parsley. Eat as is, with optional bread for dunking!</p>
