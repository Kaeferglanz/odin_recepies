# odin_recepies

In this project I will be creating a website for various recipes, which I will add to the website myself. The original link for each recipe will be at the bottom of the page. For this project I will have to write paragraphs and lists, ordered as well as unordered, as well as link websites, both local and from the internet. FInally, I will also have to add images from my local machine. 

Expectations: I expect the process to be easy, but also a bit tedious. Nevertheless I will give it my best. 8.8.2024

Reality: I was right. The process was very easy, but it was also fun seeing the project come together. On tip for my next project: Make a template file should you have to create multiple simillar files. This eases the process. 10.8.2024
